Hi hackers,

Thank you for being willing to contribute!

We welcome everyone to report issues, fork new branches, improve our wiki, or even send PRs directly.

However, we may not have enough bandwidth to handle big changes and infra-level refactoring proposed by all of you.

If you want to make large contribution (any little contribution helps us a lot though) to this project, please contact us by thousandaire-developers@googlegroups.com.

We are happy to discuss how we can work together, and make this project even better!
